            Extract k entities to replace the perspective entity in the passed sample.

            The purpose of such entities is to allow the engine to identify sufficient rules to explain the sample.
            To do so, the engine replaces the perspective entity in the sample with the extracted entities,
            and the engine analyzes the effect of adding/removing fact featuring those entities.

            The whole system works assuming that the extracted entities, when put in the passed sample,
            result in *wrong* facts, that are not predicted as true by the model;
            the purpose of the engine is identify the minimal combination of facts to added to those entities
            in order to "fool" the model and make it predict those "wrong" facts as true.

            As a consequence the extracted entities will adhere to the following criteria:
                - must be different from the perspective entity of the sample to explain (obviously)
                - it must be seen in training (obviously)
                - the extracted entity must form a "true" fact when put in the sample.
                  E.g., Michelle can not be a good replacement for Barack in <Barack, parent, Natasha>
                  if <Michelle, parent, Natasha> is already present in the dataset (in train, valid or test set)
                - if the relation in the sample has *_TO_ONE type, the extracted entities must not already have
                  a known tail for the relation under analysis in the training set.
                  (e.g when explaining <Barack, nationality, USA> we can not use entity "Vladimir" to replace Barack
                  if <Vladimir, nationality, Russia> is either in train, valid or test set).
                - the extracted entity must not form a "true" fact when put in the sample.
                  E.g., Michelle can not be a good replacement for Barack in <Barack, parent, Natasha>
                  if <Michelle, parent, Natasha> is already present in the dataset (in train, valid or test set)
                - the extracted entity must not form a fact that is predicted by the model.
                  (we want current_other_entities that, without additions, do not predict the target entity with rank 1)
                  (e.g. if we are explaining <Barack, nationality, USA>, George is an acceptable "convertible entity"
                  only if <George, nationality, ?> does not already rank USA in 1st position!)
