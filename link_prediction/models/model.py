            - store the embeddings for entities and relations

            - offer methods that use that scoring function

        that they found from the Dataset object used to initialize the Model.

        Whenever a Model method requires samples, it accepts them in the form of 2-dimensional numpy.arrays,
        where each row corresponds to a sample and contains the integer ids of its head, relation and tail.
